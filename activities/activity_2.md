## ðŸ’¿ Exercise 2.1 - Installing Docker

In order to build and run Docker containers we'll need to install Docker.

Thankfully Docker provide installers for various operating machines

Head over to their website and install **Docker Desktop** on to your computer

**NOTE:** You DO NOT have to pay or sign up for any paid subscription to complete this lab.

## ðŸ’» Exercise 2.2 - Validating installation

Once you have successfully installed Docker Desktop you should be able to run docker images from the terminal

Have a go now and see if you can see you docker version by running the `docker --version` command.

You should see something similar to:

```
docker --version

Docker version 20.10.6, build 370c289
```
